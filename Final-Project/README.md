Redirect to the directory in the terminal. To start the GUI make sure to type "make clean" and from there type "make" to compile and then to start the GUI itself, type "make run" and you will have a fully functional GUI 

Version 1.1

NOTE: This is version one and everything is done for the project itself, I will be cleaning up the code and adding files here and there to make this even more user friendly and make the GUI like a commerical product. I will also add some Easter Eggs such as the unfinished space game. Overall, the program does everything the final project has asked but I want to keep working on this during the coming break. If there are any questions or concerns, please let me know.
