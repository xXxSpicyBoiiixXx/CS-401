We are tasked with creating a GUI, graphical user interface,
comparing and running complexity amongst data search algorithms.
This included some simple sorting techniques, e.g. insertion,
bubble, merge, and quick sort. The GUI also included a random
number generator as well as an option to set up a binary search
tree. There are three files to be able to read from that each of
them include integers in increments of 10, 100, and 1000, with a
fourth option of generating a file that  has a user specified for
the number of numbers that are selected at random from one to a
million. There is a ReadMe file that will be added to the source
code on Github and we plan on making a version 2 of this GUI to
showcase to potential employers of our work. We will discuss in
detail of each component below in this document and if there are
any questions or concerns, please let us know.

This final project and the corresponding class, CS 401,
has taught us about different data structures as well as
how to implement them within a GUI. This is all done in
an IDE that support Java and we have added some Easter
Eggs inside the GUI. The operating system that was used
is the Linux kernel specifically a Debian flavor of Linux.
This GUI implementation should work on all Linux and
possibly on Windows and Mac as well. This is a simple
implementation to view the different time structures with
in different sorting, searching, and data structures. We
would like to thank Dr. Choi as well as Avinash for
conducting class in these unprecedented times.
